Loving devoted daughter of David and Lucy (both deceased); beloved sister of Geoffrey (Catherine) and Carolyn (Michael); exotic aunt of David (Mary), Brian (Ruth), Molly, Rachel (Daniel) and James; fairy godmother to George, Lucy, Xavier, Alec, Wilhelmina, Jordan, Eli, Sara Joelle and her friends' children as well. Many who cherished Ciba's warmth, charm and intellect now treasure her memory. These include childhood friends from Great Neck, fellow Morris House 1964 Smith College graduates, and colleagues in the fields of publishing and crafts design. Ciba was a brilliant, creative artist who during her career played a major role in the late 20th century crafts renaissance particularly through her contributions to Better Homes and Gardens and Victoria magazines. In recognition of Ciba's love for Paris where she lived, worked and became bilingual, a celebration of her life will be held at a French restaurant in New York on September 10. Relatives and friends unable to attend may consider gifts to Smith College in Ciba's memory.<br><br>\n ", "headline": {"main": "Paid Notice: Deaths  VAUGHAN, CIBA "}, "document_type": "article", "blog": [], "print_page": null, "subsection_name": null, "slideshow_credits": null, "abstract": null, "source": "The New York Times", "news_desk": "Classified", "type_of_material": "Paid Death Notice", "pub_date": "2016-03-19T20:01:56Z", "snippet": "VAUGHAN--Ciba Ruth.
